CSS Selectors are faster than XPath because browsers natively understand CSS for rendering ,they directly interprets CSS and locates the elements very quickly
while XPath requires a separate engine to traverse the DOM. CSS always moves forward in the DOM, making it  quicker,
whereas XPath can move both forward and backward, making it slower and more complex
